## What's Gitlab CI?
Gitlab CI is basically an implementation of a software to automate code testing and deployment on staging and then on production (based on need)

We can do a lot with CI tools basically. One of the most popular tool for automation is Jenkins. Which does the same thing. But it isn't a git-ready server. It's just for automation. Anyways, I think both of them desevers our attention and getting to know them is a very healthy decision for developers as well as automation engineers.

Gitlab CI on the other hand handles git repositories and integrates CI into it. It's basically a complete package to handle automation. Simliar thing can be done using Jenkins and Github. But that involves configuring both Jenkins and Github separately.

## How it works
